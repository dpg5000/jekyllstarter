{"name":"Jekyll Starter","tagline":"A starter project for Jekyll based blogging","body":"### What is Jekyll Starter?\r\n\r\nJekyll Starter is a bootstrap project for quickly creating a blog site based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The starter project provides a foundation based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), which is a flavor of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the clean, minimalistic styling borrowed from Lanyon, Jekyll Starter provides the following functionality out-of-the-box:\r\n\r\n* Comments using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)\r\n* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.co.in/analytics/) Integration with [superProxy](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy)\r\n  * Page view counter\r\n  * Website counter\r\n* Social sharing using [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)\r\n* Author following using [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)\r\n* Tag visualization per post\r\n* Archive organized by tags\r\n* Customizable profile picture in sidebar and about page\r\n* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) based build with CSS merge and minification\r\n\r\nThis is the base on which [anandmanisankar.com](http://anandmanisankar.com) is built.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Pre-requisites (Optional)\r\n\r\nYou will need a Disqus account, AddThis account and Google Analytics Tracking ID, if you want to integrate your blog with these services. Ensure you have enabled share and follow tools in AddThis. To make use of the Google Analytics integration, ensure you set-up and configure the Google Analytics Super Proxy as described [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/google-analytics-super-proxy). Also ensure that your super proxy returns 'ga:pageviews' and 'ga:pagePath'.\r\n(To tackle the CORS issue with super proxy, refer to my [StackOverflow response](http://stackoverflow.com/a/25758257/121241))\r\n\r\n##### Option 1:\r\n\r\nUse the [Jekyll Starter Yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-jekyllstarter) to scaffold your blog in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nTo install generator-jekyllstarter from npm, run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g generator-jekyllstarter\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, initiate the generator:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyo jekyllstarter\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnswer the questions asked by the generator, and you're blog is ready!\r\n\r\nYou can also generate a new post:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nyo jekyllstarter:newpost\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Option 2:\r\n\r\nFork the [Jekyll Starter github repository](https://github.com/msanand/jekyllstarter) and manually alter `_config.yml` based on your requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is Yeoman?\r\n\r\nTrick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.\r\n\r\nNot every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g yo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bugs / Feature Requests\r\n\r\nYou can report issues or request new features [here](https://github.com/msanand/jekyllstarter/issues).\r\n\r\n### Contribution\r\n\r\nFeel free to send a pull request in the [Jekyll Starter repository on Github](https://github.com/msanand/jekyllstarter).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"UA-53680945-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
